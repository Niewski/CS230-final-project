- Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Their Requirements <br />
The Gaming Room is a company seeking to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently an Android-only application, into a web-based, multi-platform solution. Their primary requirement is a scalable distributed system that is accessible across mobile, web, and desktop platforms while maintaining high performance and a seamless user experience.

- What Was Done Particularly Well <br />
As a software engineer with a strong understanding of APIs and system architecture, I excelled in designing a scalable and modular solution for Draw It or Lose It. My expertise allowed me to recommend and integrate gRPC for efficient communication between microservices, ensuring low latency and high performance. Additionally, I leveraged my knowledge of distributed systems to propose a robust architecture that allows scalability, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility. This technical proficiency ensured the design met both the immediate and future needs of The Gaming Room, while providing clear guidance for implementation.

- Helpful Aspects of Working Through the Design Document <br />
Developing the design document clarified the system’s requirements and constraints, allowing for a more focused and efficient approach to development. By mapping out the architecture, and defining key components in advance, it is easier to anticipate potential challenges and design solutions.

- Revisions to Improve the Work <br />
If I were to revise one part of the documentation, I would enhance the evaluation section by providing a more detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of different operating platforms. Including more quantitative metrics and real-world examples of similar applications on each platform would improve the analysis.

- Interpreting User Needs <br />
The need for scalability, platform independence, and security guided every decision in the design. For example, using a microservice architecture with gRPC ensures efficient communication between components, while a cloud-based platform allows for scalability. Considering user needs ensures the software is practical, efficient, and user-friendly, ultimately contributing to its success.

- Approach to Software Design <br />
The design process involved analyzing the client’s requirements, identifying constraints, and mapping out a scalable architecture. Techniques such as using UML diagrams aided the design. In the future, I would incorporate user feedback earlier in the process and use iterative prototyping to validate design decisions.
